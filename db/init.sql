(658,	'Pressing one or more keys on the piano\'s keyboard causes a padded hammer (typically padded with firm felt) to strike the strings.',	' On a grand piano, the whole keyboard and action shifts a bit to the left so that the hammers only hit two strings instead of three.'),

For this reason, it is often called just the pedal. It is pressed with the pianist\'s right foot, and makes the dampers (which look a bit like the hammers) that usually rests on the strings come off, so the strings are free to vibrate. As long as the pianist holds this pedal down, the notes he plays will keep on sounding even when he takes his fingers off the keys.'),
(663,	'The sustain pedal enables pianists to play musical passages that would otherwise be impossible, such as sounding a 10-note chord in the lower register and then, while this chord is being continued with the sustain pedal, shifting both hands to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the top of this sustained chord.',	' As long as the pianist holds this pedal down, the notes he plays will keep on sounding even when he takes his fingers off the keys. Some other strings will also vibrate very lightly (this is called “sympathetic vibration”), which makes the sound smoother and richer. Pianists have to learn how to use this pedal well. This will depend on such things as the style of the music, the size of the piano, the size and the acoustics of the room in which the instrument is in.'),
(664,	'Unlike the pipe organ and harpsichord, two major keyboard instruments widely used before the piano, the piano allows gradations of volume and tone according to how forcefully a performer presses or strikes the keys.',	' In the piano the strings are hit by a block of wood called a hammer. The early keyboarded instruments, such as the clavichords, harpsichords and organs that were used at that time, had a much shorter keyboard than they do today.   Gradually the keyboard became longer until it had the 88 notes (7 octaves plus three notes) of the modern piano. At first the instrument was called the “fortepiano”.   This means “loud-soft” in Italian.  '),
